Welcome to EnProg Documentation!
=================================

EnProg is a programming language designed to be simple, readable, and powerful. With EnProg, you can quickly create powerful programs without worrying about complex syntax or difficult programming concepts.

Python and Java are two significantly different programming languages with distinct syntax and paradigms. EnProg is a programming language designed to bridge the gap between these two languages, with the goal of creating a unified programming language and reducing the need to learn multiple languages. Although EnProg aims to eliminate the majority of differences between the two languages, there will inevitably be some differences that remain. However, these differences will be minimal, making it easier for developers to switch between the two variants without needing to learn a new programming language from scratch. In the future, there will be more variants that cover languages like C++, Rust, C#, etc. Like previously mentioned, once these programming languages are implemented into EnProg, they will still have noticeable differences.

This documentation will guide you through the basics of EnProg, including installation, syntax, control structures, and functions. You will also find examples and best practices to help you write clean, efficient EnProg code.

Note: the Java Variant and Python Variant have significant differences because of their different paradigms and syntax
